What is version control and why is it important?
Your response must:
•	Explain the meaning of Version Control
Version control system it is system that helps us to keep track of changes made to file and collaborate 
with others on projects. It is commonly used in software development including in tools like Git and 
GitHub. It is also used by GitHub and tracks the history of changes and managing changes to code has 
been made. As programmers make changes to the project any earlier version of the project can be regained
at any time. programmers can review project history to find out, which changes are made? And then after
it send changes to destinated repository on GitHub account.

•	Highlight a benefit of Version Control

-Version control track changes: version control system like Git allows you to track every change made 
to your files, include who made the change and when. this makes it easier to understand the history of 
your project and revert back to a specific version if needed.

-collaborate with version control, multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously. 
Each person can make their own changes and then merge them together. This makes it easier to collaborate
and avoid conflicts when multiple people are working on the same files.

-Branching and merging: version control systems allow you to create branches, which are separate copies 
of your project where you can experiment with new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.

-backup and recovery: version control act as a backup system for code. If something goes wrong or if you 
delete a file, you can easily retrieve an earlier version from the version control system.

•	Provide an application of Version Control. This means, provide an example of how Version Control 
could be used.

Version control software could provide a collaborative platform where teams can work on a project and 
automatically receive updated files. Alternatively, the team could use a cloud drive service to upload,
 download and edit files occurring at the same time to ensure everyone is working on the same version.

•	Show a command used in Version Control (for example a Git command)

Git command which is commonly used is ‘git commit’. This command is used to save your changes to the 
repository with a descriptive message.
